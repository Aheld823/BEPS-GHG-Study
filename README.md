# BEPS-GHG-Study
Data flow for GHG Model for BEPS GHG Study. Downloads data from Open data, filters it for analytical filters and removes everything except CY2019. Then defines 6 functions that represent the policy packages under consideration. Then runs each function with set of assumptions and exports it to excel. There are a couple of baseline assumptions that are made for all simulations (i.e., GHG emission factors, BEPS Property Types), which are editable by the user. For a full list of assumptions and methods please see the full report at: https://dc.beam-portal.org/helpdesk/
